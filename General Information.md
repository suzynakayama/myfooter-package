## Getting started.

Steps to get started:
1. Fork this repo.
1. Write code.
1. Push.

## Submitting your code

When done:

1. create a pull request against the original repo's `master`. This is your end product. [Here are some examples](https://github.com/MintbeanHackathons/ResumeBuilder/pulls).
1. Make sure you have finished the requirements in the `How to get points for Aesthetic Appeal` section.

## Scoring

* 33% Code Quality
* 33% Aesthetic Appeal
* 33% Code Review

## How to get points for Code Quality

1. Write code that is bug-free
1. Write code that other people can easily understand
1. Write code that other people can change without breaking things
1. Write code that is in-line with current best practices

## How to get points for Aesthetic Appeal

The best way to get points for aesthetic appeal is to deploy your project to a server.

Suggested methods:

* Codepen
* Repl.it
* Heroku
* Github Pages

If the above are not options for you, you can capture your screen and attach a video with your final push. (including with your cellphone camera, no big deal). 

As a last resort, screenshots uploaded in your final push will do.

## How to get points for Code Review

Code review means leaving constructive comments on other people's code.

Code review is assessed based on things like:
1. Valid points about the author's architecture.
1. Constructive criticism on the author's code quality.
1. Pointing out logical errors in the author's code (but being nice about it).
1. Suggestions for better ways to do things.
1. Last but not least: common courtesy and being nice. Don't be a jerk.

No points are awarded for things like:
1. Nitpicks on non-functional aspects like syntax, indentation, etc.
1. Positive comments like "Awesome!" or "Great job!" or "I like this!"
1. Harrassing, abusive or sarcastic comments (these could disqualify you and possibly get you banned)
1. Other obviously low-value comments
